Cosmology API Compatability
===========================

Most cosmology libraries are not fully compliant with the Cosmology API.
This package -- ``cosmology.compat`` -- aggregates Cosmology API compliant wrappers for the following cosmologies:

- [Astropy](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/cosmology/index.html) (see https://github.com/python-cosmology/cosmology-compat-astropy)
- [CAMB](https://camb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (see https://github.com/python-cosmology/cosmology-compat-camb)
- CLASS (In Progress)
- CCL (In Progress)
